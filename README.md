# Master Thesis, University of Passau
Topic:  **Domain-Adaptation**
- In this thesis, the development of a generalizable domain adaptation model called "Deep Domain Adaptation Concatenation Network" (DDACN) is discussed, which would help to solve various computer vision tasks. The model is trained on popular visual domain datasets for image classification tasks, and its performance is evaluated compared to other available domain adaptation methods.
-  The "Magnitude based weight pruning" technique is used to reduce the complexity of the feature extractors.
